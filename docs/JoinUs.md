We are looking for qualified and highly motivated students and postdocs with various engineering and science backgrounds (e.g., smart mobility engineering, robotics, mechanical & aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, etc.). 

If you are interested in joining our research group, we encourage you to take as many mathematics courses as possible, such as linear algebra, probabilistics, differential equations, linear programming, mathematics for AI. Additionally, it is important to improve your programming skills, particularly in languages like C and Python, though this does not necessarily need to be through machine or deep learning platforms. 

Rather than overanalyzing how each of these courses directly contributes to machine or deep learning, I recommend simply taking any course that piques your interest. If you are eager to gain research experience, you may apply for an individual study in our lab, typically during your third year or early in your fourth year, by sending me an email.

Finally, do not worry too much about your technical background or prior experience. What truly matters is your passion, attitude, and intellectual curiosity, as these qualities are far more important than innate talent when it comes to understanding the fundamentals of this field.
