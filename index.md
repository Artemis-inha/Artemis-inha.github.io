# Artemis: ARTificial Embodiment of Motion Intelligence Systems

### Prof. Junwoo Jang, Inha University

Our lab focuses on the efficient **modeling and control of robots and intelligent motion systems**. Inspired by the remarkable agility and adaptability of humans and animals in nature, we strive to replicate such athletic movements using AI-driven algorithms. To achieve this, we develop novel techniques based on optimal control theory, machine learning, and probability theory. These techniques are supported by rigorous theoretical foundations and validated through physical experiments on robotic platforms.
